# Modeling for Discrete Optimization

This repository contains non-graded assignments, workshops, and lecture models implemented while pursuing the [Discrete Optimization: Modeling & Algorithms Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-optimization-modeling-algorithms).

The specialization is composed of three courses:

- [Course 1: Basic Modeling for Discrete Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-modeling?specialization=discrete-optimization-modeling-algorithms)
- [Course 2: Advanced Modeling for Discrete Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-modeling?specialization=discrete-optimization-modeling-algorithms)
- [Course 3: Solving Algorithms for Discrete Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/solving-algorithms-discrete-optimization?specialization=discrete-optimization-modeling-algorithms)
